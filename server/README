## Firebase key
Depending on project settings may need firebase key. Go to firebase console > project settings > service accounts > create service account > follow instructions and download json key

I put my key in `functions` folder and added to gitignore. Path in `schema.js` will need to be updated depending on location. 

Would not add key to source control!

## Emulating

To emulate functions

```
cd server
firebase emulators:start --only functions
```

## Example graphiql queries 
Example graphiql queries can be found in `server\example-graphiql-queries\`.

`graphiql_example.json` shows queries
